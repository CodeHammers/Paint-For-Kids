# Paint-For-Kids

 Overview:
 ----------
 A fancy colorful application is an effective way to teach kids some computer skills. Educational games are another enjoyable way 
 for kids teaching.
 In this project (Paint for Kids) we are going to build a simple application that enables kids draw fancy shapes and also play some 
 simple games with those shapes. This application should help a kid draw a number of figures, fill them with different colors, 
 save and load a graph, and so on. The application should provide a game playing mode to teach kids how to differentiate between figures
 types, colors, sizes â€¦ etc. 
 
 
 Purpose:
 ---------
 This application will be submitted as a semester project for an object oriented programming course, it will also be our OOP learning    space.  
 
 
 Language:
 ----------
 We will be using object oriented C++ as the core of this application, we will be using CMU graphics library built in C to create the user  interface and application-user interaction.
 
 Tools:
 ------
 We will be using Visual Studio 2015 community as our IDE
 
 Framework:
 ----------
 We are using a simple graphics library called CMUgraphics ,the library itself is very limited in usage , but it let you unlesh your skills as a core c++ programmer to implement functionalities from scratch , or maybe use a base code to built upon , we recommend this library if you intend to practice c++ ,but we really don't recommend using it in production .
